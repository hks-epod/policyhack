            <p><strong>Policy Track One:</strong> DDU-GKY Trainee Job Placement</p>
            <p><strong>Policy Partner:</strong>  DDU-GKY Skills Division, Ministry of Rural Development</p>
            <strong>Problem Background:</strong> The Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) is the flagship placement-linked skill training programme under the Ministry of Rural Development of the Government of India. DDU-GKY is unique among government skill programmes in its exclusive focus on training poor rural youth. DDU-GKY expects to train 20 lakh rural youth by 2017 in a variety of trades, including retail, BPO services, hospitality, banking and accounting, and more. DDU-GKY embraces the use of IT solutions, and it is India’s first skill training programme to provide tablets for trainees, to require Aadhaar-linked biometric information on attendance, and to mandate geo-tag time-stamped records of training centres and classes.
            DDU-GKY also distinguishes itself from other training programmes by its focus on candidate retention and career progression. Affiliated training centres are required to place at least 75% of trained candidates in formal sector employment paying at least Rs. 6,000.
            Currently, placement occurs solely through the training partners’ efforts, and many trainees who are placed migrate far from their native communities for the first time. Another obstacle to employment is the lack of documentation – trainees often have no way to demonstrate police verification (of identity and clean records) or employment history.
            <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> There are many challenges to providing employment opportunities to candidates and encouraging employment retention, including the following:
            <ul>
              <li>There is no systematic means by which employers can tap into this pool of DDU-GKY trainees for recruitment, and there is no central market for DDU-GKY candidates to search for employment.</li>
              <li>Employers look to hire in batches but lack matching and planning tools to recruit trainees.</li>
              <li>There is no means to level the playing field so candidates from particularly disadvantaged</li>
              <li>backgrounds can more easily connect to formal employment opportunities.</li>
              <li>There is no matching engine that takes text format job descriptions and recommends</li>
              <li>candidates based on their profiles while keeping the unique needs of the rural youth trainee
            population in mind.</li>
            <li>Trainees who migrate face many challenges related to relocation. They often lack
            appropriate support, leading some to leave their jobs and return home.</li>
            <li>Employers are often wary of hiring candidates without police verification of identity and
            proof that they have no cases pending against them.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The challenge is to build a platform/tool which facilitates job placement and retention in a way that meets job seekers’ needs and is attractive to potential employers.</p>

            <p><strong>Policy Track Two:</strong>Education in India</p> 
            <p><strong>Policy Partner:</strong> Central Square Foundation</p>
            <p><strong>Problem Background: </strong> School enrollments continue to climb across India, with primary gross enrollment well over 100% <sup>1</sup>  and gross enrollment reaching 68.5% for secondary school (2011) and 24.8% at the tertiary level (2012). At the same time, the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) has indicated that the percentage of Standard 5 children who can read a Standard 2 text actually dropped from 53% in 2006 to 48% by 2014 <sup>2</sup>. Public spending on education cannot explain these trends: according to the Center for Global Development, the median cost of educating a child in a private school in India in 2011- 2012 was Rs. 5,961. The same cost for public was over twice this amount at Rs. 14,615 <sup>3</sup>.</p>
            <p>Data on schooling inputs and outcomes exists, but it is not clear that parents and administrators have access to information that helps them more easily understand educational outcomes compared to inputs in their area and push local school officials for improvements.
            This hackathon track is being posed by the Central Square Foundation, a Delhi-based organization that aims to ensure all Indian children receive a high quality school education. They are keen to support powerful ideas and innovations that can help the Indian educational system meet this goal.
            Problem Statement: Your challenge is to create a tool by which parents and public officials can understand how educational institutions perform in their area and put pressure on education officials to improve the system. Users should be able to understand not only information about their own localities, but also ensure they know how they are doing compared to similar localities. Finally, data may contain errors, so ensuring the system has a process for improving data quality is critical.</p>

           <br> <p><strong>Policy Track Three:</strong> Clean Water for All in Delhi</p>
          <p><strong>Policy Partner: </strong>Delhi Dialogue Commission, Government of Delhi</p>
          <p><strong>Problem Background:</strong> The Delhi government is committed to ensuring that all residents have access to clean water, and that water is managed responsibly. This goal is ambitious but important: 45% of Delhi households are not linked to the water sewerage network, and the Comptroller and Auditor General estimates that the Delhi Jal Board loses upwards of Rs. 1,000 crore annually from corruption and mismanagement.</p>
          <p>More specifically, water is frequently wasted and mismanaged; access is extremely inequitable and many residents – frequently slumdwellers – do not have access to piped water or a sewage network and must rely on water tankers for access; grievance redressal systems do not work effectively; and, crucially, much of Delhi’s water system is extremely polluted and poses a threat to residents’ health and environmental sustainability. True to its commitment to swaraj and its fight against corruption, the government would like to draw on Delhi residents’ vast knowledge to inform the government of water- related problems, hold officials accountable, and provide a groundswell of information that can be used to propel crucial improvements in the water and sewerage systems. Improved, publicly available information on water usage and management are necessary inputs that can improve the system.</p>
          <p><strong>roblem Statement:</strong>   Your challenge is to build a tool (mobile/web app, etc.) that will help the Delhi government meet one or more of its goals for water management. Challenges that the government would like to address with citizens’ help include identifying and fighting corruption in the water tanker system; identifying instances of waterway pollution by industries and domiciles sending untreated effluents and garbage into the Yamuna River; pinpointing and addressing inefficiencies in the current water delivery and sewage system; and making information available to the public and media to increasingly hold officials accountable to the public for improved water management.</p>

            <p><strong>Policy Track Four: </strong> Countering Counterfeit Products </p>
            <p><strong>Policy Partner:</strong>   Department of Consumer Affairs, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, is Consumer Advocacy</p>
            <p><strong>Problem Background: </strong>The mandate of the Department of Consumer Affairs, situated in the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, is Consumer Advocacy. Translating this mandate into action entails enabling consumers to make informed choices, fostering fair, equitable and consistent outcomes for consumers, and facilitating timely, effective and affordable consumer complaint redress. Government at the Centre and the states recognize the enormity of the challenge, given the relatively low awareness of consumer rights and the prevalence of predatory, exploitative or unfair trade practices.</p>
            <p>In particular, counterfeit products, such as food, medicines, and agricultural inputs (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, etc.) pose a major threat to the health and livelihoods of consumers. There is currently no centralized system for consumers to report counterfeit items to the government. There is also a need for technologically supported outreach by which the Department of Consumer Affairs can effectively raise awareness about these issues among rural Indians, the group presumably most affected by counterfeit products. Improving information flows in both directions, to the government and back to the citizens, could help reduce counterfeit manufacturing, improve consumer awareness, and ultimately save lives.</p>
            <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Your challenge is to create a system that can help the Department of Consumer Affairs effectively speak to, and hear from, all Indians, regardless of geographic location, socioeconomic status, connectivity, language, or any other characteristics. Such a system would ideally meet the following goals:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Clearly identify fake or counterfeit products, address complaints, and track progress on dealing with problems</li>
            <li>Learn from complaint patterns and prioritize areas for follow-up</li>
            <li>Creatively leverage India’s communication networks – both human and technology-based - to help the Department raise consumer awareness about the dangers of counterfeit products. The potential remoteness and low literacy levels of relatively less empowered populations should be considered for both complaint registration and awareness building.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Policy Track Five: </strong>Open Track</p>
            <p>Under the open track, developers have the opportunity to work on any topic of their choosing related to a policy or implementation problem in India. Some suggested topic areas that developers could explore are women’s safety, urban air pollution, or integrated monitoring of rural development schemes. Teams working under the open track should be able to clearly define their chosen topic as a problem statement and are encouraged to consult with PolicyHack mentors during this stage of problem formulation. Projects under this track will be evaluated similarly to other tracks but will also be judged on the importance and relevance of the chosen topic. Open track teams are encouraged to incorporate any sources of open data available to them.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
